# Comments

# Numbers and math

All general java operands are supported.

(//)  forces integer division (useful on floats)

round(10.0) = 10

# Boolean

# Strings

* operator on strings multiplies the string


Multiline string is written as:
"""
asdfasd
asdf
"""

print function takes multiple "arguments" and prints them

print "asdf", 1
result = asdf 1

len(string) - returns the length of the string

# Files

open(filename) - returns a file object from given filename
read() - reads entire file and returns content
close() - closes a file -> necessary after opening a file
write(content) - writes content to file
truncate() - empties the file
readline() - reads one line of text
exists(filename) - checks if file exists - exists in os.path module

open() function takes a second parameter which can be 'w', 'r', 'a' and these parameters can have modifiers on them (like + modifier)
default parameter is 'r' - read mode

file does not need to be closed explicitly if it is opened and read in one line - like open(filename).read(). - Check this!!
